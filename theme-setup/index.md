General notes and suggestions for customizing **Neo-HPSTR**.

## Basic Setup for a new Jekyll site

1. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and then install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork the [Neo-HPSTR Jekyll Theme repo](http://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/fork).
3. Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, assigning categories and tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

<div markdown="0"><a href="http://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme/archive/master.zip" class="btn">Download the Theme</a></div>

**Pro-tip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.

## Setup for an Existing Jekyll site

1. Clone the following folders: `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass`, `assets`, and `images`.
2. Clone the following folders/files and personalize content as need: `posts/`, `tags/`, `feed.xml` and `index.html`.
3. Set the following variables in your `config.yml` file:

{% highlight yaml %}

## Running Jekyll

If `jekyll build` and `jekyll serve` throw errors you may have to run Jekyll with `bundle exec` instead.

> In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.
>
>However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.

## Customization

Most of the variables found here are used in the .html files found in `_includes` if you need to add or remove anything. A good place to start would be to add the `title`, `description`, and `url` for your site.

### Disqus Comments

Create a [Disqus](http://disqus.com) account and change `disqus_shortname` in `_config.yml` to the Disqus *shortname* you just setup. By default comments appear on all post and pages if you assigned a shortname. To disable commenting on a post or page, add the following to its YAML Front Matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
comments: false
{% endhighlight %}

### Social Share Links

To disable Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ share links on a post or page, add the following to its front matter:

{% highlight yaml %}
share: false
{% endhighlight %}

### Floating Social Share Links

To enable floating share links on the left of the screen, edit it on `_config.yml`:

{% highlight yaml %}
float_share: true
{% endhighlight %}


### Owner/Author Information

Change your name, and avatar photo (200x200 pixels or larger), email, and social networking URLs. If you want to link to an external image on Gravatar or something similar you'll need to edit the path in `_includes/author.html` since it assumes it is hosted on your site.

### Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools

Your Google Analytics ID goes here along with meta tags for [Google Webmaster Tools](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=35179) and [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://ssl.bing.com/webmaster/configure/verify/ownershi) site verification.

### Top Menu - Navigation Links

To add additional links in the menu edit `_config.yml`. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you'd like. *External links will open in a new window..* You can create a sub-category using the `submenu` item. Also, you can list your post categories setting the `type: 'categories'`


{% highlight yaml %}
menu:
  - title: 'Home'
    url: '/'
  - title: 'Fork'
    url: 'http://github.com/aron-bordin/neo-hpstr-jekyll-theme'
  - title: 'Install'
    url: '/theme-setup/'
  - title: 'Tags'
    url: '/tags'
  - title: 'Categories'
    url: '/categories'
    type: 'categories'
  - title: 'Favorites'
    url: '#'
    submenu:
      - title: 'highlighter'
        url: '/code-highlighting-post/'
      - title: 'intro'
        url: '/readability-post/'
{% endhighlight %}

## Adding New Content with Octopress

While completely optional, I've included Octopress and some starter templates to automate the creation of new posts and pages. To take advantage of it start by installing the [Octopress](https://github.com/octopress/octopress) gem if it isn't already.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install octopress
{% endhighlight %}

### New Post

Default command

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new post "Post Title"
{% endhighlight %}

Default works great if you want all your posts in one directory, but if you're like me and want to group them into subfolders like `/posts`, `/portfolio`, etc. Then this is the command for you. By specifying the DIR it will create a new post in that folder and populate the `categories:` YAML with the same value.

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new post "New Portfolio Post Title" --dir portfolio
{% endhighlight %}

### New Page

To create a new page use the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ octopress new page new-page/
{% endhighlight %}

---

### Jekyll _includes

For the most part you can leave these as is since the author/owner details are pulled from `_config.yml`. That said you'll probably want to customize the copyright stuff in `footer.html` to your liking.

### Reading Time

On by default. To turn off remove `reading_time` from `_config.yml`. Default words per minute is set at 200 and can changed by updating `words_per_minute` in `_config.yml`.

#### Post/Page Thumbnails for OG and Twitter Cards

Post and page thumbnails work the same way. These are used by [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) meta tags found in `head.html`. If you don't assign a thumbnail the image you assigned to `site.owner.avatar` in `_config.yml` will be used.

Here's an example of what a tweet to your site could look like if you activate Twitter Cards and include all the metas in your post's YAML.

![Twitter Card summary large image screenshot]({{ "/images/twitter-card-summary-large-image.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

### Videos

Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of [FitVids](http://fitvidsjs.com/).

Adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix wrap the html within `{::nomarkdown}` tags. Example below:

{% highlight html %}
{::nomarkdown}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PWf4WUoMXwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{:/nomarkdown}
{% endhighlight %}

### Twitter Cards

Twitter cards make it possible to attach images and post summaries to Tweets that link to your content. Summary Card meta tags have been added to `head.html` to support this, you just need to [validate and apply your domain](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) to turn it on.

### Link Post Type

Link blog like a champ by adding `link: http://url-you-want-linked` to a post's YAML front matter. Arrow glyph links to the post's permalink and the the `post-title` links to the source URL. Here's an [example of a link post]({{ "/sample-link-post/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) if you need a visual.

## Style Customization

Here you'll find some useful scss variables to help you to customize your Blog interface. All variables can be found at `_sass/_variables.scss`.

#### Top Navbar Size

To change its size, edit the **`$menu-height`** value. It's recommended a value between 50px and 100px. This variable will automatically update the icon and menu size for you.

#### Top Navbar Colors

The navbar uses two colors, the top color and overflow color. The top color represents the navbar color when the window is not scrolled and the overflow color represents the color when we have a sufficient scroll to change its color.

You can change these colors using the **`$menu-top`** and **`$menu-overflow`** variable values.

#### Top Navbar hover color

The color that you see in the item under the mouse can be changed in the **`$header-margin`** variable.

---

## Further Customization

Jekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme's fonts and colors. By editing values found in `_sass/variables.scss` you can fine tune the site's colors and typography.

For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you'd change `$bodycolor: #fff;` to `$bodycolor: $cc0033;`.

To modify the site's JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into `scripts.min.js`. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), then [install Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started), and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in `package.json`:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install
{% endhighlight %}

From the theme's root, use `grunt` to concatenate JavaScript files and optimize `.jpg`, `.png` and `.svg` files in the `images/` folder.

You can also use `grunt dev` in combination with `bundle exec jekyll serve` to watch for updates in JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code, which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.
